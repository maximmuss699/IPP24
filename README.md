## IPPcode24 Parser and Interpreter 


## Overview
This project consists of two main parts: a parser written in Python 3.10 and an interpreter written in PHP 8.3. These tools are designed to analyze and interpret the unstructured imperative language IPPcode24, enabling the conversion of IPPcode24 source code into an XML format (by the parser) and the subsequent execution of this XML (by the interpreter).
